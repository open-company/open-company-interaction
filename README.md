## Background

> Tell the truth about any situation and you are delivered from lack of progress, but become hypocritical or lying, and you may be in bondage for life.

> -- [Auliq Ice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/auliqice/)

Employees and investors, co-founders and execs, they all want more transparency from their startups, but there's no consensus about what it means to be transparent. OpenCompany is a platform that simplifies how key business information is shared with stakeholders.

When information about growth, finances, ownership and challenges is shared transparently, it inspires trust, new ideas and new levels of stakeholder engagement. OpenCompany makes it easy for founders to engage with employees and investors, creating a sense of ownership and urgency for everyone.

[OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/) is GitHub for the rest of your company.

To maintain transparency, OpenCompany information is always accessible and easy to find. Being able to search or flip through prior updates empowers everyone. Historical context brings new employees and investors up to speed, refreshes memories, and shows how the company is evolving over time.

Transparency expectations are changing. Startups need to change as well if they are going to attract and retain savvy employees and investors. Just as open source changed the way we build software, transparency changes how we build successful startups with information that is open, interactive, and always accessible. The OpenCompany platform turns transparency into a competitive advantage.

Like the open companies we promote and support, the [OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/) platform is completely transparent. The company supporting this effort, OpenCompany, LLC, is an open company. The [platform](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-web) is open source software, and open company data is [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) accessible through the [Storage Service API](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-api).

To get started, head to: [OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/)


## Overview

The OpenCompany Interaction Service handles reading, writing and propagating user comments and reactions.


## Local Setup

Users of the [OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/) platform should get started by going to [OpenCompany](https://opencompany.com/). The following local setup is **for developers** wanting to work on the platform's Interaction Service software.

Most of the dependencies are internal, meaning [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 8 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.5.1+ - Clojure's build and dependency management tool

#### Java

Chances are your system already has Java 8+ installed. You can verify this with:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have Java 8+ [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Leiningen

Leiningen is easy to install:

1. Download the latest [lein script from the stable branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein).
1. Place it somewhere that's on your $PATH (`env | grep PATH`). `/usr/local/bin` is a good choice if it is on your PATH.
1. Set it to be executable. `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/lein`
1. Run it: `lein` This will finish the installation.

Then let Leiningen install the rest of the dependencies:

```console
git clone https://github.com/open-company/open-company-interaction.git
cd open-company-interaction
lein deps
```

## Usage

Run the interaction service with: `lein start`

Or start a REPL with: `lein repl`


#### REPL

Next, you can try some things with Clojure by running the REPL from within this project:

```console
lein migrate-db
lein repl
```

Then enter these commands one-by-one, noting the output:

```clojure
;; start the development system
(go) ; NOTE: if you are already running the service externally to the REPL, use `(go 3737)` to change the port

;; create some interactions

                           :entry-uuid "abcd-5678-abcd"
                           :reaction "ðŸ˜€"} author))

                                   :entry-uuid "abcd-5678-abcd"
                                   :interaction-uuid "5678-abcd-5678"
                                   :reaction "ðŸ‘Œ"} author))
```


## Technical Design

The interaction service is composed of 4 main responsibilites:

- CRUD of comments and reactions
- WebSocket notifications of comment and reaction CRUD to listening clients
- Pushing new comments to Slack
- Receiving new comments from Slack

The Interaction Service shares a RethinkDB database instance with the [Storage Service](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-api).

## Testing

Tests are run in continuous integration of the `master` and `mainline` branches on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-interaction):
