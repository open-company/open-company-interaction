## Background

> Tell the truth about any situation and you are delivered from lack of progress, but become hypocritical or lying, and you may be in bondage for life.

> -- [Auliq Ice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/auliqice/)

Companies struggle to keep everyone on the same page. People are hyper-connected in the moment but still don't know what's happening across the company. Employees and investors, co-founders and execs, customers and community, they all want more transparency. The solution is surprisingly simple and effective - great company updates that build transparency and alignment.

With that in mind we designed the [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) software-as-a-service application, powered by the open source [OpenCompany platform](https://github.com/open-company). The product design is based on three principles:

1. It has to be easy or no one will play.
2. The "big picture" should always be visible.
3. Alignment is valuable beyond the team, too.

Carrot simplifies how key business information is shared with stakeholders to create alignment. When information about growth, finances, ownership and challenges is shared transparently, it inspires trust, new ideas and new levels of stakeholder engagement. Carrot makes it easy for founders to engage with employees and investors, creating alignment for everyone.

[Carrot](https://carrot.io/) is GitHub for the rest of your company.

Transparency expectations are changing. Organizations need to change as well if they are going to attract and retain savvy employees and investors. Just as open source changed the way we build software, transparency changes how we build successful companies with information that is open, interactive, and always accessible. Carrot turns transparency into a competitive advantage.

## Overview

The OpenCompany Interaction Service handles reading, writing and propagating user comments and reactions.


## Local Setup

Prospective users of [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) should get started by going to [Carrot.io](https://carrot.io/). The following local setup is **for developers** wanting to work on the OpenCompany Interaction Service.

Most of the dependencies are internal, meaning [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 8 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.5.1+ - Clojure's build and dependency management tool
* [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/) v2.3.6+ - a multi-modal (document, key/value, relational) open source NoSQL database
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - Secure web tunnel to localhost

#### Java

Chances are your system already has Java 8+ installed. You can verify this with:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have Java 8+ [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Leiningen

Leiningen is easy to install:

1. Download the latest [lein script from the stable branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein).
1. Place it somewhere that's on your $PATH (`env | grep PATH`). `/usr/local/bin` is a good choice if it is on your PATH.
1. Set it to be executable. `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/lein`
1. Run it: `lein` This will finish the installation.

Then let Leiningen install the rest of the dependencies:

```console
git clone https://github.com/open-company/open-company-interaction.git
cd open-company-interaction
lein deps
```

#### RethinkDB

RethinkDB is easy to install with official and community supported packages for most operating systems.

##### RethinkDB for Mac OS X via Brew

Assuming you are running Mac OS X and are a [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) user, use brew to install RethinkDB:

```console
brew update && brew install rethinkdb
```

If you already have RethinkDB installed via brew, check the version:

```console
rethinkdb -v
```

If it's older, then upgrade it with:

```console
brew update && brew upgrade rethinkdb && brew services restart rethinkdb
```


Follow the instructions provided by brew to run RethinkDB every time at login:

```console
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/rethinkdb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

And to run RethinkDB now:

```console
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rethinkdb.plist
```

Verify you can access the RethinkDB admin console:

```console
open http://localhost:8080/
```

After installing with brew:

* Your RethinkDB binary will be at `/usr/local/bin/rethinkdb`
* Your RethinkDB data directory will be at `/usr/local/var/rethinkdb`
* Your RethinkDB log will be at `/usr/local/var/log/rethinkdb/rethinkdb.log`
* Your RethinkDB launchd file will be at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rethinkdb.plist`

##### RethinkDB for Mac OS X (Binary Package)

If you don't use brew, there is a binary installer package available for Mac OS X from the [Mac download page](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/osx/).

After downloading the disk image, mounting it (double click) and running the rethinkdb.pkg installer, you need to manually create the data directory:

```console
sudo mkdir -p /Library/RethinkDB
sudo chown <your-own-user-id> /Library/RethinkDB
mkdir /Library/RethinkDB/data
```

And you will need to manually create the launchd config file to run RethinkDB every time at login. From within this repo run:

```console
cp ./opt/com.rethinkdb.server.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rethinkdb.server.plist
```

And to run RethinkDB now:

```console
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rethinkdb.server.plist
```

Verify you can access the RethinkDB admin console:

```console
open http://localhost:8080/
```

After installing with the binary package:

* Your RethinkDB binary will be at `/usr/local/bin/rethinkdb`
* Your RethinkDB data directory will be at `/Library/RethinkDB/data`
* Your RethinkDB log will be at `/var/log/rethinkdb.log`
* Your RethinkDB launchd file will be at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rethinkdb.server.plist`


##### RethinkDB for Linux

If you run Linux on your development environment (good for you, hardcore!) you can get a package for you distribution or compile from source. Details are on the [installation page](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/).

##### RethinkDB for Windows

RethinkDB [isn't supported on Windows](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1100) directly. If you are stuck on Windows, you can run Linux in a virtualized environment to host RethinkDB.

#### ngrok

ngrok allows you to setup a secure web tunnel for HTTP/S requests to your localhost. You'll need this
to utilize the Slack webhook during local development so Slack can communicate with your local development
environment.

ngrok is trivial to setup:

1. [Download](https://ngrok.com/download) the version for your operating system.
1. Unzip the download and put ngrok someplace handy for you (in your path is good!)
1. Verify you can run ngrok with: `ngrok help`


## Usage

Run the interaction service with: `lein start`

Or start a REPL with: `lein repl`

#### REPL

Next, you can try some things with Clojure by running the REPL from within this project:

```console
lein migrate-db
lein repl
```

Then enter these commands one-by-one, noting the output:

```clojure
;; start the development system
(go) ; NOTE: if you are already running the service externally to the REPL, use `(go 3737)` to change the port

;; create some interactions

(def author {
  :user-id "c133-43fe-8712"
  :teams ["f725-4791-80ac"]
  :name "Wile E. Coyote"
  :first-name "Wile"
  :last-name "Coyote"
  :avatar-url "http://www.emoticonswallpapers.com/avatar/cartoons/Wiley-Coyote-Dazed.jpg"
  :email "wile.e.coyote@acme.com"
  :auth-source "slack"
})

(interaction/create-comment! conn
  (interaction/->comment {:org-uuid "abcd-1234-abcd"
                          :board-uuid "1234-abcd-1234"
                          :resource-uuid "abcd-5678-abcd"
                          :body "That all looks great to me!"} author))

(interaction/create-reaction! conn
  (interaction/->reaction {:org-uuid "abcd-1234-abcd"
                           :board-uuid "1234-abcd-1234"
                           :resource-uuid "abcd-5678-abcd"
                           :reaction "ðŸ˜€"} author))

(interaction/create-comment-reaction! conn
  (interaction/->comment-reaction {:org-uuid "abcd-1234-abcd"
                                   :board-uuid "1234-abcd-1234"
                                   :resource-uuid "abcd-5678-abcd"
                                   :interaction-uuid "5678-abcd-5678"
                                   :reaction "ðŸ‘Œ"} author))
```

A Slack webhook is used to mirror Slack replies to OpenCompany comments back into OpenCompany.

To use the webhook from Slack with local development, you need to run ngrok, then configure your Slack integration.

First start the Interaction Service (see above), and start the ngrok tunnel:

```console
ngrok http 3002
```

Note the URL ngrok provides. It will look like: `http://6ae20d9b.ngrok.io` -> localhost:3002

To configure the Slack to use the ngrok tunnel as the destination of message.channel events. Go to
[Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click the "OpenCompany (Local Development)" app.

Click the "Event Subscriptions" navigation in the menu. Click the toggle on.

Add the URL provided by ngrok above, modifying `http` to `https` and with a `/slack-event` suffix,
e.g. `https://6ae20d9b.ngrok.io/slack-event`

 Click the "Add Team Event" button and add the `message.channel` event. Click the "Add Bot User Event" button and
 add the `message.channel` event.

Click the "Save Changes" button.

NB: Make sure when you are done testing locally, you disable the "Enable Events" toggle so Slack will stop trying
to echo events to your local environment via ngrok.


## Technical Design

The interaction service is composed of 4 main responsibilities:

- CRUD of comments and reactions
- WebSocket notifications of comment and reaction CRUD to listening clients
- Pushing new comments to Slack
- Receiving new comments from Slack

![Interaction Service Diagram](https://cdn.rawgit.com/open-company/open-company-interaction/mainline/docs/Interaction-Service.svg)

The Interaction Service shares a RethinkDB database instance with the [Storage Service](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-storage).
